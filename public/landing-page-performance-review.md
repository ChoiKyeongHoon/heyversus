# Landing Page Performance Enhancement Plan

## Overview

The landing page currently uses dynamic Server-Side Rendering (SSR) for all requests. This ensures data is always fresh but results in unnecessary database queries and slower page loads for every user visit, as the "Featured Polls" content does not change frequently.

## Key Recommendation: Enable Caching

To significantly improve performance and reduce database load, we should leverage Next.js's Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) with time-based revalidation.

### Action Item

In `src/app/page.tsx`, enable revalidation by adding the following line:

```typescript
export const revalidate = 3600; // Revalidate every hour
```

This change will cache the landing page for one hour, dramatically speeding up Time to First Byte (TTFB) for most users while still allowing the page to be updated periodically with fresh data.
